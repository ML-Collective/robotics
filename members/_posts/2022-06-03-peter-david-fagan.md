Hi there, thanks for stopping by my profile. I am a robotics researcher who is passionate about open-source software and collaboration. I am delighted to also be an active member of the MLC robotics interest group. 

If you are new to robotics and have questions, feel free to tag me in these questions within the robotics interest group discord channel. I was fortunate to have guidance from other roboticist who helped me transition into the field. I wish to help other aspiring roboticists where/when I can.
