Hi there. I am currently a Masters student at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. Before starting my masters, I was an android developer with a Tiktok like Indian startup. I started my AI journey with Udacity's AI course and since then I've been on and off and have finally figured that I want to learn about the mind and make robots do cool stuff. My research interests are within the realm of Computer science and reinforcement learning for robotics. I'm currently at the - [RAIL LAB](https://raillab.org). 


If you're interested in the lab - [JOIN HERE](https://raillab.org/joining-the-lab), have a look at the publications - [HERE](https://raillab.org/publications)

I'm a big potterhead and when I'm not doing all the above, I'm enjoying life with mentoring people at [Mentorcruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/NileshArnaiya/) or books, movies, yoga, ngos and exploration of apps. I also blog - [Blog](https://nilesharnaiya.github.io/blog)
