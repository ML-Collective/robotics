Hello! Thank you for visiting my profile. I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), USA. I'm exploring basically the Autonomous Ground Veichles and trying to solve related problems with different Machine Learning algorithms (e.g. Reinforcement Learning). 

I'm trying my best to be active both in Reinforcement Learning and Robotics research interests group at MLC. Feel free to tag me there for any related discussion and helps. Hoping to learn together with other active members!
